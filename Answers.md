1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

  React is a javascript library that uses state that can be sychronized with from all throughout an application. It solves issues of getting data from all around the app and having to rerender large parts of it. React can update the view of the ui without reloading the page.

1. Describe component state.

	State is like a container that can have data in it. It can be updated and update other things as it is.

1. Describe props.

	Props are the properties of a component that can be passed down from parent to child through key/value pairs put within the component tag. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

  Side effects are interactions inside of an application that will cause changes outside of the scope of the function that caused the changes.
